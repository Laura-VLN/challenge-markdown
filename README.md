## A funny story


Quick Belgium was my client when I was working at IPG Mediabrands as a Community Manager. I had to take pictures for their Facebook and Instagram accounts.


What you don't know as a eater of burgers ? 


I had to buy every part of the uncooked burger at Quick and bring that back at the office.
Then I had to redo the puzzle, use a syringe to put the sauce and take the pic.
I was hated by some of my colleagues because of the smell :smile:

### I've been a burger builder as a Social Media Manager :thumbsup:
